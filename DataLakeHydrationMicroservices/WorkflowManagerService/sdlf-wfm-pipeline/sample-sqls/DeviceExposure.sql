--Device Exposure Query
--This query provides a holistic view of customerâ€™s path to conversion based on different devices vs combination of devices (PC, TV, Mobile, Tablet) for DSP campaigns

--Note: You can also filter out the desired Campaigns and perform analysis only for those campaigns by adding adding a campaign filter in the where clause

--Perform a union all from three tables to collect KPIs from the display_impressions,display_clicks and amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time tables
