      2. **platform_manager/datalake_hydration_microservices/wfm/customerConfig_wfm_sample** - Provides a sample notebook to add/update/delete AMC instance related details for an existing onboarded AMC instance or tenant.
      3. **platform_manager/datalake_hydration_microservices/wfm/workflowLibrary_wfm_sample** - Provides a sample notebook to add/update/delete pre-loaded AMC workflows which will be applicable to all new AMC instance or teant which are onboarded to the platform.
      4. **platform_manager/datalake_hydration_microservices/wfm/workflowSchedules_wfm_sample** - Provides a sample notebook to add/update/delete AMC workflow schedules for existing AMC instance or tenant which are already onboarded to the platform.
      5. **platform_manager/datalake_hydration_microservices/wfm/workflows_wfm_sample** - Provides a sample notebook to add/update/delete AMC workflow details for existing AMC instance or tenant which are already onboarded to the platform.
      6. **platform_manager/datalake_hydration_microservices/wfm/workflow_invoke_wfm_sample** - Provides a sample notebook to adhoc (out of schedule) invocation of AMC workflows fro a particular AMC instance or tenant.

### Parameters

Before deploying the pipeline, ensure that the `platform_manager_parameters` dictionary in the `cdk.json` file contains the correct following parameters for the **WFM** stack:

1. `team` â€” The name of the team which owns the pipeline.

The `cdk.json` is the same level as `app.py` within `orion-satellite`. If the parameters are not filled, default values for team will be used (i.e. demoteam).

### Deployment

Refer to the Orion AMC QuickStart Deployment Steps in order to deploy this stack.
