*Q:* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error in CloudFormation when I deployed the Quick Start.

*A:* Ensure that you have bootstrapped the AWS accounts in use by running the following command, replacing the information in brackets.

`ddk bootstrap --profile <AWS_PROFILE> --trusted-accounts <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>`

Also ensure that the `ddk.json` file specifies the correct AWS account for the child environment used to deploy (for example, default is set to `dev`).

*Q:* I can't find the configuration for my AMC instance.

*A:* In the AMC user interface, you can view the *Instance Information* page for detailed information on the AMC instance S3 bucket, endpoint URL, data-upload account, advertiser IDs, and entity IDs. You can also retrieve this information by raising a ticket to the AMC team.
