Amazon Marketing Cloud is a secure, privacy-safe, and dedicated cloud-based environment in which advertisers can easily perform analytics across multiple, pseudonymized data sets to generate aggregated reports. Inputs can include an advertiserâ€™s own data sets, as well as their Amazon Ads campaign events, such as impressions, clicks, and conversions. AMC reports can help with campaign measurement, audience refinement, supply optimization, and more, enabling advertisers to make more informed decisions about their cross-channel marketing investments.
Advertisers can access hundreds of fields about their Amazon media campaigns via Amazon Marketing Cloud including ad-attributed impressions, clicks, and conversions. Advertisers can also choose to upload their own pseudonymous data sets into a dedicated Amazon Marketing Cloud data clean room environment and join the data sets with Amazon Ads campaign events for analysis.  +
