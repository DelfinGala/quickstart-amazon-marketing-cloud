// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.

The deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete. While the stack is in progress, you can monitor the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1[AWS CloudFormation], link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?region=us-east-1[AWS CodeBuild] and link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines?region=us-east-1[AWS CodePipeline] consoles for errors or failures. 

NOTE: After signing in to the console, confirm that the `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1` Region is selected in the top toolbar.

Once the stack is deployed, do the following:

. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home?region=us-east-1[Amazon Athena console]. 
. Choose your user name in the top toolbar in the upper right (for example, `username@account_ID_number_or_alias`). 
. Choose **Switch Role**. If this is the first time choosing this option, a page appears with more information. After reading it, choose **Switch Role**. 
. On the **Switch Role** page, for **Account**, enter the AWS account ID number.
. For **Role**, enter the following. Substitute your information for `<demoteam>`.
+
`@<demoteam>-saw-datalake-users-us-east-1`. 

. Choose **Switch Role**.
. On the **Query editor** page, for **Workgroup**, choose your workgroup. (For example, `demoteam-demodl-dev-workgroup`.)

NOTE: For more information on switching roles, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html[Switching to a role (console)].

== QuickSight dashboards

// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

Below are examples of Amazon QuickSight dashboards and the queries you can run to build them. In the queries, substitute your information for `<demoteam>`.

* **Audience Analysis.** Analysis of audience segments for purchases of customer products on Amazon.
+
`SELECT * FROM "<demoteam>_amcdataset_dev_stage"."testdemocustomer_audience_analysis_adhoc" limit 10;`

* **Frequency Distribution.** Analysis of performance and delivery by different frequencies and impression exposures. Helps optimize campaign frequency caps to maximize the conversion likelihood for purchases of assigned customer products on Amazon.
+
`SELECT * FROM "<demoteam>_amcdataset_dev_stage"."testdemocustomer_device_exposure_adhoc" limit 10;`

* **Device Exposure.** Performance metrics, such as return on ad spend (ROAS), impressions, conversions, and clicks, across device types for purchases of assigned customer products on Amazon.
+
`SELECT * FROM "<demoteam>_amcdataset_dev_stage"."testdemocustomer_frequency_distribution_adhoc" limit 10;`

* **Geo Analysis.** Analysis of performance data by geographic location, such as designated marketing area (DMA), for purchases of assigned customer products on Amazon.
+
`SELECT * FROM "<demoteam>_amcdataset_dev_stage"."testdemocustomer_geo_analysis_adhoc" limit 10;`

* **Product Mix Analysis.** Performance data of users exposed to both sponsored products (SP) and display campaigns (DSP) and their key performance indicators (KPIs).
+
`SELECT * FROM "<demoteam>_amcdataset_dev_stage"."testdemocustomer_product_mix_adhoc" limit 10;`
